Hi, I’m @bustardchad, currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Santa Barbara, CA.

My physics doctoral work (and what I continue researching today) was in theoretical and computational astrophysics, specifically to better understand galaxy evolution. On a day-to-day basis, that means I utilize and extend hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation frameworks in Fortran and C/C++, run simulations on national supercomputers, and analyze results with Python-based analysis and visualization tools. To learn more about my specific research projects, check out my personal website: https://bustardchad.wixsite.com/mysite

This GitHub serves as a storage and backup tool for some of my favorite visualization and analysis scripts, some graduate school class projects in parallel computing and computational MHD, as well as my own independent study in data science, machine learning, and other fun topics!

To get in touch, please contact me at bustard@ucsb.edu.
