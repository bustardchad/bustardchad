Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Chad Bustard, and I'm a data scientist and computational astrophysicist building high-performance simulations and machine learning models to study galaxy evolution. I'm currently a Climatebase Fellow (Cohort 4) lending data and ML/AI expertise to several capstone projects and early-stage climate technology startups. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Santa Barbara, CA and an NSF Graduate Fellow in the University of Wisconsin - Madison physics department (Physics PhD 2020).

## Quick overview of my public github activities:

### ðŸ’« Astrophysics:

<https://github.com/bustardchad/ML_Turb> -- Software supporting Bustard and Wu 2023, submitted to Machine Learning Science and Technology. Included scripts and notebooks extract, normalize, and load images from 3D turbulence simulations, train and fine-tune convolutional neural networks (for classification) and U-nets (for variable mapping), and interpret results with image modifications and saliency maps (Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.) 

<https://github.com/bustardchad/research_overview> -- A set of instructive Jupyter notebooks showing how to analyze astrophysical simulation data with various data analysis tools (e.g. Jupyter, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, astropy, yt). There's also a small amount of Fortran thrown in, plus a successful supercomputing proposal because why not. 

<https://github.com/bustardchad/Cosmic_Ray_Turbulence> -- Python scripts supporting the research published in Bustard and Oh 2022 and Bustard and Oh 2023 probing the interplay between cosmic rays and magnetized turbulence.

### ðŸŒ² Climate technology:

<https://github.com/stedn/down-the-block> -- Climatebase collaboration to explore and model a co-op-based carshare concept in Madison, WI. Data-driven insights and interactive maps (geopandas, Folium), integration with Google Maps API (javascript, html) 

### ðŸ˜ƒ Just for fun:

<https://github.com/bustardchad/Langing_CRs> -- Brief exploration of LangChain for arXiv document summarization and Q/A chatbot creation, tested on my own publications (LangChain, HuggingFace, LLMs)
