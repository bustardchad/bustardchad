Hi, I’m @bustardchad, currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Santa Barbara, CA.

I specialize in theoretical and computational astrophysics, specifically to better understand galaxy evolution. On a day-to-day basis, that means I utilize and extend hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation frameworks in Fortran and C/C++, run simulations on national supercomputers, and analyze results with Python-based analysis and visualization tools.

To learn more about my specific research projects, check out my personal website: https://bustardchad.wixsite.com/mysite
