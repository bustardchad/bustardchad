Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Chad Bustard, and I'm a data scientist and computational astrophysicist building high-performance simulations and machine learning models to study galaxy evolution. I'm currently a Climatebase Fellow (Cohort 4, Fall 2023) lending data and ML/AI expertise to several capstone projects and early-stage climate technology startups. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Santa Barbara, CA and an NSF Graduate Fellow in the University of Wisconsin - Madison physics department (Physics PhD 2020).

### Quick overview of my public github activities:

#### ðŸ’« Astrophysics:

<https://github.com/bustardchad/ML_Turb> -- Software supporting Bustard and Wu 2024, submitted to Machine Learning Science and Technology. Included scripts and notebooks extract, normalize, and load images from 3D turbulence simulations, train and fine-tune convolutional neural networks (for classification) and U-nets (for variable mapping), and interpret results with image modifications and saliency maps (Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.) 

<https://github.com/bustardchad/research_overview> -- A set of instructive Jupyter notebooks showing how to analyze astrophysical simulation data with various data analysis tools (e.g. Jupyter, Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, astropy, yt). There's also a small amount of Fortran thrown in, plus a successful supercomputing proposal because why not. 

<https://github.com/bustardchad/Cosmic_Ray_Turbulence> -- Python scripts supporting the research published in Bustard and Oh 2022 and Bustard and Oh 2023 probing the interplay between cosmic rays and magnetized turbulence.

#### ðŸŒ² Climate technology and geospatial analysis:

<https://github.com/stedn/down-the-block> -- Climatebase collaboration to explore and model a co-op-based carshare concept in Madison, WI. Data-driven insights and interactive maps (geopandas, Folium), integration with Google Maps API (javascript, html) 

<https://github.com/bustardchad/sb_flooding> -- Independent project using Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 imagery to visualize and quantify flooding impacts in Santa Barbara, CA in January 2023.

<https://github.com/bustardchad/GaussianProcess> -- Gaussian process regression using Scikit-learn to interpolate between 2D spatial point data. So far, I've applied this to measured noise levels in my city of Madison, WI, but it could be applicable to any 2D point measurement data in the required format. 

#### ðŸ˜ƒ Just for fun:

<https://github.com/bustardchad/Langing_CRs> -- Brief exploration of LangChain for arXiv document summarization and Q/A chatbot creation, tested on my own publications (LangChain, HuggingFace, streamlit, LLMs)
